mw	Pretty funny spec. I really liked that the scope of the document matched the scope of the social network. A full-featured social network would require a TON of more specification, but this is the perfect amount of documentation to understand the function of this social network. My main nitpick is that I'd like it if the document was formatted a bit better. Its just a text file but the lines just wrap randomly and can make it a bit hard to skim through. Good job otherwise.	
w5	Nice document, and I like the honest opening haha. I liked the formatting of the document and it had a good amount of detail.
w7	I like it, seems like a good idea. Would like a little more detailed descriptions about how everything looks and works, but otherwise good job.
er	Pretty good. One nitpick is that I'd like some nicer formatting for the document. The text just wraps over lines randomly and breaks the indentation formatting.
cu	The formatting of this one was good, and the document had a good level of detail about a few different features. I'd like some more line breaks so that lines aren't randomly wrapping over like they are now. 
d4	Not bad. The opening descriptions were good, but everything after felt very sparse, I'd like if there was more detail about how everything works.
hw	Although what is there is clear, and otherwise ok, it feels very incomplete. I would like to see much more detailed descriptions about how everything on the site is supposed to look and work. From how a user registers and logs in, to how they're presented news stories. The document leaves me with more questions than answers.
