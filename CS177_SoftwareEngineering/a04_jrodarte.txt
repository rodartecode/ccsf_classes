=====
Overview [OV1]
=====

TableFriends is an online social network specifically
tailored to board and table game fans, combining features
of contemporary social networks (Like friends, news feeds,
and profiles) with those of popular webgame portals (such 
as many genres of games, private and public lobbies, and 
matchmaking ranking systems to group players of similar 
skill together).

This is an INCOMPLETE document in both content and 
formatting. Details are subject to change as the product 
is developed and scope is better defined.


=====
User Stories [OV2]
=====

The following are a few fictiotious scenarios to show 
how a hypothetical user might interact and use 
TableFriends on a typical basis.


SCENARIO 1: Guadalupe
Guadalupe is a 20 year old college student. When Guadalupe
was still in high school they would frequently play card
games with friends after school. Unfortunately they have
all moved away to different colleges and no longer keep in
touch. Guadalupe hears about a really good website where
you can play card games online with your friends. They
search for the site's memorable name in their search 
browser and proceed to register a new  account.

The registration process is quick and easy and are quickly
taken to their new profile. Guadalupe becomes excited and 
decides to invite all their old friends to join as well!
They add each other as friends and within minutes are 
playing a card game together again.

Now Lupe and their friends have a weekly hang out again,
where they play their old favorites like War and Speed, 
and catch up about their lives at their new schools.


SCENARIO 2: Ariel
Ariel is passionate table gamer. Although they grew up
playing Chess, they quickly discovered a passion for
other competetive games. Ariel began competing in more
tournaments for games like Magic, Scrabble, and Diplomacy.

Now they are a very active TableFriends user who
participates and often wins online tournaments. They
have a very large friends list including real life 
friends and new friends they met through playing in
online matchmade games.


SCENARIO 3: Rene
... incomplete.


=====
Risks and Assumptions [OV3]
=====

There will need to be careful consideration for
agreements made with game publishers over how the
games are used. This will especially be a problem
for the newer boutique games, which we expect to 
be popular with our user base.

Additionally the anti-cheat systems should be very
robust, espeically since they're going to be used 
in prize awarding tournaments.

=====
Non-Goals
=====

This version of the site will not be truly cross
platform. Friends list, activity feed, and access
to messages will be available, although in a
limited format.

Games will NOT be available on mobile devices for
this version of the site.



~~~~~~~~~~

=====
User Experience [UX1]
=====

This section will detail the various sections of
the site available to users and how they will 
interact with them.

All webpage elements will be made in HTML5,
but the exact implementations of the games
themselves is still to be decided.


=====
Welcome Screen [UX2]
=====

When users first open the site they will be
greeted by a small, simple splash screen showing
the TableFriends logo, a couple of small blurbs,
and a prompt to sign-in or register a new account.

The prompt will have a single field to enter the
user's email, with a choice to either "Register"
or "Log-in". When they make the choice they will
be forwarded to the respective page.

=====
Registration [UX3]
=====

Users will be shown a series of fields with
general acount information. They must have 
a valid e-mail which they will have to verify,
and a valid password which meets the minimum
password strength requirements. They will also
have to confirm their date of birth to ensure 
they're old enough to use the site.

There will be additional optional fields where
they can specify their location, gender,
favorite games, and other biographical info.
After they've filled out the registration form,
the user will be sent an e-mail cotaining a 
URL link for them to click which will verify
their e-mail.

Once the e-mail address has been verified they
will be forwarded back to the Welcome Screen
where they will now be able to log in.


=====
Log-in [UX4]
=====

To log-in each user will need to enter the 
password associated with their account. If
the password is succesful they will be
forwarded to their Activity Feed.

=====
Profile [UX5]
=====

The User's Profile contains all their info,
inlcuding biographical information, profile
picture, recently played, and any trophies
or acheivements that they're received from
playing in online games.

=====
Friends [UX6]
=====

The User's Friends List will have a list of
all the other user's who they've added as
friends.

Users will be able to add each other by going
to another user's profile and clicking the 
big "Add Friend" button. Once the other user
has confirmed they will both appear in each
others' friends list.

Friends can send each other invites to games,
receive alerts when other friends are playing
a game, and send each other private messages.


=====
Activity Feed [UX7]
=====

The Activity Feed is the user's home base. 
This is where they will be taken to everytime
they log-in. 

The main feed takes up most of the center of 
the screen. It will show a chronological list
of recent posts by friends, games played, 
acheivements and trophies earned, and so on.

Also accessible from this screen will be a 
toolbar which will contain links to pages
like their Friends List, their inbox,
and the game portal from which they will
be able to join or host game sessions.



~~~~~~~~~~

=====
Games [GA1]
=====

Games featured include: 
  - Standard "classic" games such as Chess and Checkers
  - Tradiational "card games" like Poker, Hearts, and 
    War
  - Contemporary "craft" board games like Ticket To
    Ride, and Settlers of Catan
  - Abstract "role playing" table games, like Shadowrun
    and GURPS.
  NOTE: No rights have been secured, game list is NOT
        final

Unranked lobbies are lobbies where there is no 
player ratings. Any user is able to join 
regardless of skill level. These lobbies

=====
Ranked Lobbies [GA4]
=====

Ranked lobbies are match-made by the server-side
game coordinator. Once a user decides to join a
Ranked Lobby, they will be put in a queue until 
they can be matched up with a similarly skilled
player (or group of players).

Depending on the results, the winner(s) will be
awwarded a certain amount of Ranking Points and
will be matched with high skilled players in 
future match-made sessions. The inverse will be
true for the loser(s).

=====
Acheivements [GA5]

Every game will have a list of acheivements that
users can earn through playing the games. Once
a user unlocks an acheivement they will be awarded
a digital badge, which they can then display in 
their profile.

TableFriends where large groups of users
can compete against each other over a few hours.

Tournaments may feature prizes, including digital
trophies which users can display on their profiles.

To-Do [TO1]
=====

This section contains a list of the next tasks
to be completed for to finish this document.

- All sections need much more detailed content.
- The formatting can be improved to help the 
  different sections be more easily 
  distinguished.
- Add all the rest of the things I haven't done
  to this list
- I'm sure I'm missing something else, but this 
  is probably good enough for today.
