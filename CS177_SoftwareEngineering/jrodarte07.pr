hi	Nice write-up, I remember reading about when this came out. Good job.
p2	Good write-up. Interesting that this one has a bug that was known about but still implemented in lots of software for years and still hasn't been resolved. Though I guess this was supposed to be about bugs that WERE solved, this is still an interesting case.
gg	What a pain, man I hate overdraft fees. This is another bug that was known about and willfully ignored for ulterior motives.
u2	This was a good one. Really helps to give perspective on the process of tracking a bug from start to finish which is really helpful to have.
s5	Good writeup. Very interesting to see the bug known lifetime from first report to finally being resolved by the devs.
n0	Kind of interesting. So in the end it wasn't all the way fixed, more like just a workaround. But it sounds like a problem that mostly effects a very small amount of people.
dd	Kind of a short write-up. It is an old bug that that it seems just took them forever to fix. Or at least until it was about to become a real issue.
