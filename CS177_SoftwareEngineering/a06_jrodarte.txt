Write 200-400 words describing your experience 
cloning a GitHub project of your choice on hills, 
then making some edit to the repository and 
asking git to display the diff.


Working with a version control system will be
a vital skill to learn if you plan on working
on teams in a development environment. Since
git has become the defacto standard of the 
industry its important gain familiarity using
these tools. I have used git in a very basic
manner to put some of my previous assignments
from other classes on github, so already had
some passing familiarity with the workflow of
using git.

Still, I very much appreciate that git is not
a very user friendly tool to use. Being a 
command line program, it can be hard to
visualize just that exactly is happening when
you're creating and modifying these repos. I
know that there are some 3rd party tools as 
well as integrated tools that help present
the information about your repos in a much
more easily readable file. Still, I'm going
to do my best to get more comfortable in the
command line. Plus it does feel way cooler 
when you do it that way.

Personally, I had to try a few times to clone
one of my repos from github onto hills. I did
eventually get it though, and played around a
bit checking the log, adding and removing files,
and checking the diff. I look forward to
learning more about git, and maybe I'll even get
into that Version Control class that's starting
soon.
