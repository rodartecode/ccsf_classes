fx	Good introduction, and I agree with you list as well. I wish we had stricter digital privacy laws like the EU.
jw	Good list, seems like a good way to collect and store sensitve data
x2	Yeah, good point, I agree. I wish we had stronger legislated protections to our digital privacy.
w6	Interesting idea to pick and choose what data you share. The system sounds very secure, but I would worry about latency to the Mariana Trench. I guess that's an issue for a different assignment anyways.
jx	Seems like an appropriate list, I can get behind it.
cm	A little dry and a bit short, but straight to the point.
gt	WTF - oops this is a peer review
