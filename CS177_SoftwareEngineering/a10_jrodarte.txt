It's always seemed to me that the hard thing about data, especially
in the increasingly digital world that we live, is that it's 
entirely intrinsic to any behavior or activity we could do. There
is no way to hide your data in a moment because it's part of it's
very existence. The only way not to share data in many contexts,
is to not exist in that context.

This means that to use any service we are willingly allowing our
data to be collected. With this in mind, it's important to 
maintain some control over the appropriate use of our data. Using
these guidelines is a firm step in the right direction.

Uniquely identifiable data about a user should never be collected
without a User's consent, and any usage of the data be made VERY
explicit to the User.

Identifiable data about a User's daily habits outside of the
software product should never be collected. User's must trust
that any data collected by a Software Product be explicitly 
pertinent to that product.

Any and all Anonymized data about a User must be made explicit
to the User.

User's should be able to access any and all Identifiable data 
collected about them by a product.

User's must have a Right to be Forgotten and request that any
identifiable data collected about them be deleted from all
related servers/databases.

These are just a few of the most important guidelines for 
maintaining ethical and desirable usage of a User's data.
