k9	Instructions were completely clear, can't see anything wrong at all.
y3	The instructions were general enough and clear. I could make it to class reading these.
g1	Instructions were clear, I think I could make it to class with these directions.
c3	Those GPS coordinates though. The instructions pretty clear, but I'm a little curious about the GPD coordinates of your favorite chair in class.
jw	Instructions were mostly clear, although there were a couple that seemed a bit too vague. Especially "traverse path" as there are a lot of paths around that part. I apreciated the appendix of subroutines.
j3	No starting point is specified, but luckily I have enough familiarity with campus to infer after the first step. Other may not however. The nexted branching paths are also unique and mostly clear.
rt	Some of these sound like literal google maps directions and it seems a little unclear where "50 Phelan" actually is. It says to cross the street but "50 Phelan" should be on the right side of the street already. After a little reverse engineering I realize you started from the parking lot. Once I got that, it made sense. Still, the last part of the assignment "How many kinds of actions did you use?", is missing.
