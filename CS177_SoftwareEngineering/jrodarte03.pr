x3	I really like how these were organized. It made it so much easier to read knowing what each section was about instead of a bunch of different requirements all mixed together (like I did haha). It also explicitly states what requirements haven't been decided on yet, which is actually very helpful. Only criticism is that I would appreciate some prioritization personally.
m5	Well written requirements. After reading them I felt I'd gotten answers to questions I didn't know I had.
dr	These requirements seem clear and easy to read. Also they seem like things that could be tested easily.
av	Instructions were clear, well-formatted and easy to read. Only criticism is that it's a bit short and the features range from very basic to extremely complicated so the scope feels a bit wonky.
33	The instructions were well-formatted and very easy to read. When they popped up on my terminal I felt a nice relief to see nice clean text. The requirements were all a bit too vague and some outright subjective. What kind of "outside sources"? What does it mean to "influence content"? I like the idea of the requirements, but felt they left me with more questions than answers.
cr	To me, the requirements seem to swing back and forth between very specific and extremely vague. It lists specific browsers to work on and how database backup systems will function, but also glosses over how material will be flagged as violating copyright and how user identities an be proven. An ID number but what kind of ID number? I felt I had more questions than answers after reading the requirements.
rt	WTF. Last week's assignment.
