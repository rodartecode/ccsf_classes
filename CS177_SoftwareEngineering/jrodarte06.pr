ww	Good job, well written. Included some issues and how you resolved them.
t9	Good job, seems you didn't struggle too much with the assignment.
58	Good job. I forgot to add a commit message when I commited, so that was a good reminder of how to do it from the command line.
ax	Nice work. I totally get you about how comfusing git can be, especially if you're not used to using the command line. Also the other person won't get your changes unless you push them onto their remote and then they accept the changes. Until then the changes live only on your system.
pu	Nice write-up. I agree using git from the command line can be really confusing and unintuitive at first. And it definitely doesn't help to keep getting into the vi editor every time, which I don't think is how it's supposed to work. Hopefully with some practice it'll get easier for you!
78	Nice job. Seems like you didn't have too much trouble with it.
i6	Good work. I agree the git tutorial is really dry and a bit confusing if you're not familiar with git terminology.
