  In my entire life Educational Software has always
carried with it this preconceived notion that it is
probably going to be an unituitive clunky time. This
past experience is proven true once again whenever I
use Web 4.

  To it's credit, I understand that there are far 
worse software out there, but at CCSF it's always
stood out to me for looking terribly dated in a time
when slick responsive interfaces have become so 
commonplace. While once you've gotten used to it, it
is actually very easy to find your classes and make
payments, explaining to somebody who's never used it
how to do these things is not so easy.

  Where most modern user interfaces have learned to
intuitively organize menus with dropdowns and use 
all of the available screen space effectively,
Web 4's barren all text presentation looks like it's
still stuck in the 90's Geocities era. Everything is
presented as a wall of text with only the blue color
of the hyperlinks to distinguish the any of the 
words aparrt. Accessing Web4 from a phone is an 
identical experience as on a computer browser, 
except you have to pinch and scroll all over the
page so that your fat fingers can click the right
link.

  Honestly though it's very useable once you learn
how to quickly navigate to what you want to do. It
seems the worst parts of it's usability is it's 
appearance and how unattractive and unhelpful it 
appears to somebody who has never used it.

  It seems appropriate then, that I found out that
CCSF is switching to a new system called Banner 9
in the next few weeks. I already checked out a
video about it, and it certainly looks nicer and 
seems to have some new features, not to mention
a dedicated app. Hopefully it's a painless 
transition.
