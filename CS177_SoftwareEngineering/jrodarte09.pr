03	I totally agree that a lot of the menus on web4 are very unintuitive. I believe that if you pick one of the options at the payment screen the next screen will show the free CCSF discount applied.
j3	Ugh, working on a slow computer is the worst, I would just bring my own laptop as well. I'm not completely about HDD's being the cause, but whatever the cause it's very frustrating.
uu	Web4 is extremely clunky, I'm glad we're switching to a new system very soon.
p1	I've never had to use this, but it sounds quite old/used. I guess it being worn down also makes it a bit hard to use.
ap	Yeah, if you don't know how to use linux or a command line interface then hills can be quite confusing. I'd recommend the beginner linux classes offered here at CCSF. I took one over the summer and it was very helpful.
g8	I agree that git is very difficult to use when you don't have experience with it. I suppose for now it's optional,  but if you pursue a career in software development you're gonna have to learn it eventually.
x3	Probably spent a bit too long talking about UI/UX and not enough on the specifics of what makes the usability bad. In the context of the CCSF home page, it might not be ideal for current students but that page is meant for new or interested students. I agree it should be easier for current students to find where the list of classes though.
