y0	Good methodology, seems appropriate for our intentions in this class.
gp	Good write-up. The scope was supposed to be our groups and the small project we're going to be doing in this class. 
qr	Good methodology, appropriate scope for our class.
ir	Nice document format. I mostly like the methodaology, but it seems a bit much for what we're going to be doing in the class, which was the scope the methodolgy was supposed to cover, I thought. 
cp	Seems like pretty good methodology. Maybe a little overkill for a small team of 3-5, but hey its good to go for it!
yz	This seems good to me. It might be a bit much for the dev work we'll do in this class, but it's still a good foundation.
u5	Pretty good write-up, but I'm pretty sure the scope was supposed to cover the dev work we'd be doing in our groups in this class so this might be a bit overboard. Still, good job.
