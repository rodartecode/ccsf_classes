Having learned C++ as my first programming language, the
concept of constant variables is very familiar and 
comfortable to me, so I was glad to see these were also
available in bash. I recently did a project using python
and when I found out I couldn't make constant variables
I was very perturbed. I expect to use constant variables
quite liberally in my scripts.

Aliases seem to be quite useful for your own personal 
shell usage, but it seems their usage in scripts is a
bit limited. I had originally tried to do everything in
the same script,  including declaring and using aliases.
I wasn't able to get it to work and all solutions I could
find online seemed to suggest doing some sort of strange 
workarounda. Because of this I ended up doing all my alias
testing in my interactive shell instead and redirect the
output to an output file.

Aliases are going to be quite useful to me now that I have 
a better understanding of how they work. I'm already 
planning on creating some for my windows command prompt at
work to make it a bit more familiar for me to use and get
more comfortable.

The exec command is still a bit confusing, but I read the
man page and the tldp.org section and some discussion on 
Stackoverflow. It's still a little confusing, but I'm
planning expirementing with it more to redirect input and
output to and from files, which will be very useful.
