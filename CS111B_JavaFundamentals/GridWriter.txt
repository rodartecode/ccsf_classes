GridWriter Assignment

1.  In the GridWriter program every time it calls the add method to add My 
    Circles and MyRectangles it uses polymorphism. The add method works with
    GridItem object but we pass in our custom shape class objects. The same is
    true about the display method. The display method uses GridItems, but we
    use MyCircle and MyRectangle objects.
2.  They are in scope because they are inhereted from the GridItem class.
3.  GridItem's containsPoint method never gets called because it's overwritten
    by the MyCircle and MyRectangle obects that we created.
4.  The compiler gives errors because the containsPoint methods can no longer
    see the x or y variables in the GridItem class and thus no longer inherits
    them.
5.  Since the GridItem's containsPoint method is never called it can be made
    abstract. The same can be done with the getArea method. The whole class
    can be abstract it seems.
6.  The GridItems class could be made into an interface, and be implemented by
    different custom classes.
