      >Hello, nice to meet you! My name is Jesse Rodarte, I'm a Computer Science Student at CCSF. My favorite things to
      do are play videogames with my friends and ride my bike. These days I've been too busy with school and trying to
      survive in the city that I haven't had much time to ride. At this point I haven't done a long ride in years. I
      hope that this year that will change and I can get back on the road!</p
    >

      >I have been very pleased with my new journey into the field of software and web development. Luckily I have had
      the good fortune to be eiligible for San Francisco's free City College program. Through this I've taken classes in
      web development, databases, Linux/Unix, DevOps, and Software Engineering. I will be able to graduate at the end of
      the year with an AS and 3 certificates. I hope that all this experience will help me quickly get a job in the
      industry.</p

      >My favorite website is
      <a href="http://www.lichess.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LiChess</a> where you can play chess
      online against people from all over the world. I like it because it's a very simple site that's easy to use and
      very responsive. It's also an open-source project which means that all the code that makes it run is freely
      available <a href="https://lichess.org/source" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on their website</a>.
      Although the code is extremely complicated, I think the fact that it's accessible is very cool.</p
