          Hello, nice to meet you! My name is Jesse Rodarte, I'm a Computer Science Student at CCSF. My favorite things
          to do are play videogames with my friends and ride my bike. These days I've been too busy with school and
          trying to survive in the city that I haven't had much time to ride. At this point I haven't done a long ride
          in years. I hope that this year that will change and I can get back on the road!
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been very pleased with my new journey into the field of software and web development. Luckily I have
          had the good fortune to be eiligible for San Francisco's Free City College program. Through this program I've
          taken classes in web development, databases, Linux/Unix, DevOps, and Software Engineering. I will be able to
          graduate at the end of the year with an AS and 3 certificates. I hope that all this experience will help me
          quickly get a job in the industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          My favorite website is
          <a href="http://www.lichess.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LiChess</a>
          where you can play chess online against people from all over the world. I like it because it's a very simple
          site that's easy to use and very responsive. It's also an open-source project which means that all the code
          that makes it run is freely available
          <a href="https://lichess.org/source" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on their website</a>. Although
          the code is extremely complicated, I think the fact that it's accessible is very cool.
