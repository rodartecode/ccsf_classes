              >Learning to work with frameworks and libraries is a big next step that will be very important for the
              growth of your web development ability. There are frameworks and libraries for every aspect of Web
              Development, but probably the most common and universal library used in projects small and large is
              Bootstrap CSS library. The best resource that I could find to learn bootstrap is the official W3 school
              documentation, and learning how to leverage this technology will be very beneficial for every web
              developer, whether they do front-end or back-end.</p

              the time it takes you to produce a new layout. To start you can visit one of the many sites that offer
              free bootstrap layouts and use one of their, or for inspiration, such as:</p

              >Once you&#39;ve learned Bootstrap and are comfortable with all the HTML and CSS fundamentals, the next
              thing you need to master is Javascript, which is the most popular front and back-end programming language
              today. The way I learned was on CodeAcademy. While most of their content is paid, their intro courses are
              usually free. This is a great guided way to learn all the basic syntax and concepts of JavaScript:</p

              available to do anything there is to do. Like animate elements on window scrolling:</p

            <p
              >The next step is to learn the basics of code organization in a web project. Probably the most common
              architecture right now is the MVC app, which stands for Model-View-Controller. In this architecture the
              responsibilities of presentation, logic, and state are separated from each other. This article does a
              great job of explaining the concept and implementing a very simple MVC app using just HTML, CSS, and
              JavaScript.</p

          <p
            >If you would like to pursue a career in back-end programming than the next crucial step is to learn about
            Data Structures &amp; Algorithms. Courses on these subjects are taught at CCSF in both C++(110C) and
            Java(111C), I would highly recommend taking one of these courses at CCSF. If you can&#39;t take on of these
            courses, you can always find lots of free content and material online. If you&#39;re willing to find a free
            or cheap book, and put in the time to teach yourself, it is completely possible. Once useful video, is this
            2 hours long YouTube video on Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript. It moves very fast, and
            doesn&#39;t cover everything you would cover in a semester-long class, but you can still learn a lot.
            It&#39;s available for free on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel:</p

            there also numerous classes at CCSF to learn this topic, but you can also learn for free online! There are
            actually so many free resources to learn SQL (the defacto database querying language), that I&#39;m just
            going to link to a list of 25 free ways to learn it:</p

            >Once you&#39;ve learned all the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the next step is to learn one of the
            many popular frameworks to build web applications. The most popular JavaScript frameworks are React, Vue,
            and Angular, but I&#39;m actually going to suggest something completely different. This past winter 2019, I
            read the book The Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl, and it was an excellent guide on how to build a
            full stack web-application. I&#39;d never done any Ruby before reading this book, but was still able to
            complete the whole book and build a twitter-like web app, with database integration, git, a complete user
            authorization and authentication system, while learning and following test-driven development best
            practices, and finally deploying the project to Heroku. It is a holistic guide to almost every aspect of a
            modern web-app. This is the only paid thing on this list, but I feel it was well worth it. The Ruby on Rails
            Tutorial is available for \$39 at:</p

            >Another important aspect to learn about if you wish to become a back-end developer are good engineering and
            design principles. Out of this need have come the SOLID principles. This next article is actually one I got
            from one of Claudia&#39;s classes that I took many semesters ago. I thought that it was so good and
            interesting that I saved it to my bookmarks and I still have it to this day. It&#39;s a long read but is
            very detailed and enlightening:</p

            <h3 id="git">Git</h3>
            <p
              >One of the most important parts of web development is knowing how to work in a team. One of the most
              important tools in use to assist this is the Git Version Control System. Git helps developers who are
              working on the same project to work on their own versions of the code so that their changes don&#39;t
              interfere in what the other developers are working on. Once a feature has been show to work correctly,
              without errors or side-effects, the changes merged into the main codebase that everybody shares. This is a
              30m &quot;crash course&quot; about git, how to use it, and why. It&#39;s taught by Brad Traversy who
              actually has an excellent YouTube channel where he goes over every web development topic you could think
              of, in every single language that there is. I highly recommend this channel in general:</p

              >Another important tool that any developer will use daily is the terminal. Since we&#39;re using the
              terminal so often, it&#39;s very beneficial to learn bash. Although you don&#39;t necessarily need to
              learn all the advanced topics, knowing the basics will be useful to any developer. A free way to learn all
              the basic topics is learnshell, which is an interactive site that guides you through all the shell
              features:</p
