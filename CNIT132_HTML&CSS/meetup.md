These resources are meant for students who have completed CNIT132 and are looking for what's next in Web development.

# Front End

## Bootstrap

Learning to work with frameworks and libraries is a big next step that will be very important for the growth of your web development ability. There are frameworks and libraries for every aspect of Web Development, but probably the most common and universal library used in projects small and large is Bootstrap CSS library. The best resource that I could find to learn bootstrap is the official W3 school documentation, and learning how to leverage this technology will be very beneficial for every web developer, whether they do front-end or back-end.

Once you've learned the most important basics, you can take that knowledge and dramatically reduce the time it takes you to produce a new layout. To start you can visit one of the many sites that offer free bootstrap layouts and use one of their, or for inspiration, such as:

https://bootswatch.com/

## Javascript

Once you've learned Bootstrap and are comfortable with all the HTML and CSS fundamentals, the next thing you need to master is Javascript, which is the most popular front and back-end programming language today. The way I learned was on CodeAcademy. While most of their content is paid, their intro courses are usually free. This is a great guided way to learn all the basic syntax and concepts of JavaScript:

Once you've got the basics down, you can learn how to use one of the many, many JavaScript libraries available to do anything there is to do. Like animate elements on window scrolling:

## MVC

The next step is to learn the basics of code organization in a web project. Probably the most common architecture right now is the MVC app, which stands for Model-View-Controller. In this architecture the responsibilities of presentation, logic, and state are separated from each other. This article does a great job of explaining the concept and implementing a very simple MVC app using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# UI and Design

## Vector Patterns

There are so many free resources for UI, icons, layouts, or any other design need. It makes sense to skim available free collections for something you could use, or for inspiration.

One such site, it paaatterns, which hosts collections of vector graphics you can download and edit in numerous different formats:

https://products.ls.graphics/paaatterns/

Also worth mentioning is a very similar site humaaans, which has free vector graphics to create silhouette people for your app:

## Generators

There are also many tools available to generate graphics or icons for your application. Such as Hero Generator, which creates an appropriate "Hero" image out of any image you upload

Similarly there are sites which generate favicons out of pictures you provide:

# Back end

## Data Structures and Algorithms

If you would like to pursue a career in back-end programming than the next crucial step is to learn about Data Structures & Algorithms. Courses on these subjects are taught at CCSF in both C++(110C) and Java(111C), I would highly recommend taking one of these courses at CCSF. If you can't take on of these courses, you can always find lots of free content and material online. If you're willing to find a free or cheap book, and put in the time to teach yourself, it is completely possible. Once useful video, is this 2 hours long YouTube video on Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript. It moves very fast, and doesn't cover everything you would cover in a semester-long class, but you can still learn a lot. It's available for free on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel:

## Database

If you're working on the backend then you'll need to learn how to work on Databases. Of course, there also numerous classes at CCSF to learn this topic, but you can also learn for free online! There are actually so many free resources to learn SQL (the defacto database querying language), that I'm just going to link to a list of 25 free ways to learn it:

## Frameworks

Once you've learned all the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the next step is to learn one of the many popular frameworks to build web applications. The most popular JavaScript frameworks are React, Vue, and Angular, but I'm actually going to suggest something completely different. This past winter 2019, I read the book The Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl, and it was an excellent guide on how to build a full stack web-application. I'd never done any Ruby before reading this book, but was still able to complete the whole book and build a twitter-like web app, with database integration, git, a complete user authorization and authentication system, while learning and following test-driven development best practices, and finally deploying the project to Heroku. It is a holistic guide to almost every aspect of a modern web-app. This is the only paid thing on this list, but I feel it was well worth it. The Ruby on Rails Tutorial is available for \$39 at:

## Engineering Principles

Another important aspect to learn about if you wish to become a back-end developer are good engineering and design principles. Out of this need have come the SOLID principles. This next article is actually one I got from one of Claudia's classes that I took many semesters ago. I thought that it was so good and interesting that I saved it to my bookmarks and I still have it to this day. It's a long read but is very detailed and enlightening:

# Other

## Git

One of the most important parts of web development is knowing how to work in a team. One of the most important tools in use to assist this is the Git Version Control System. Git helps developers who are working on the same project to work on their own versions of the code so that their changes don't interfere in what the other developers are working on. Once a feature has been show to work correctly, without errors or side-effects, the changes merged into the main codebase that everybody shares.
This is a 30m "crash course" about git, how to use it, and why. It's taught by Brad Traversy who actually has an excellent YouTube channel where he goes over every web development topic you could think of, in every single language that there is. I highly recommend this channel in general:

## The Terminal

Another important tool that any developer will use daily is the terminal. Since we're using the terminal so often, it's very beneficial to learn bash. Although you don't necessarily need to learn all the advanced topics, knowing the basics will be useful to any developer. A free way to learn all the basic topics is learnshell, which is an interactive site that guides you through all the shell features:
